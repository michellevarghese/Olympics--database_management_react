# Olympics--database_management_react

Problem Statement –
The Olympic Games held every four years are one of the most prestigious sports competitions in 
the world. There is a lot of planning and management that goes into organizing the various 
events - managing judges, players, their logistics, accommodation, etc. The database we are 
constructing will be event focused and give details about the athletes, judges and medals while 
also giving an insight into how these events are managed by the IOC (International Olympics 
committee). Through this database, we will be able to infer - which venue the events are held, the 
players participating, the medals they win and the equipment required for the corresponding 
sport (if any).
Requirements –
1. The IOC management registers all the events and disciplines of the sports that are going 
to be held in that particular year. They also plan the budget for that particular year. This 
is decided by coordinating with the hosting country and the broadcasting companies.
2. Every country registers with the IOC indicating whether they would be participating in 
the Olympic Games that year and sends in the list of participants from their respective 
country, along with the player details like age, weight, height, team details, etc.
3. The IOC decided the venues and schedules for every event.
4. They bring in experienced judges to score every event and also give penalties to the 
players who violate the rules of the game.
5. The IOC manages any sort of equipment that would be required for a particular sport.
6. The IOC also sell tickets to the people who wish to spectate any particular event.
